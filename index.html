    <h1>Akan Names Generator</h1>
    <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
        Most people do not know when their birthdays are and some might not know the day of the week they were born. These names have meanings concerning the soul and character of the person </p>
        <p>This web application helps users to calculate the day of the week they were born and then give them a name depending on their gender. </p>
